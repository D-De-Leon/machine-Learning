# Machine Learning Project Showcase

Welcome to my Machine Learning Project Showcase repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my skills and experience in the field of machine learning.

Projects
The following is a list of projects included in this repository:

Project 1: This project involves a classification problem where I have used a Random Forest algorithm to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not based on their browsing history.
Project 2: This project involves a regression problem where I have used a Linear Regression algorithm to predict the price of a house based on various features such as the number of rooms, location, etc.
Project 3: This project involves a natural language processing (NLP) problem where I have used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify text into one of several categories.
Each project folder contains a README.md file that provides more information about the project, including the problem statement, the approach taken, the data used, the models implemented, and the results obtained.
